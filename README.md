# drumkit-random-sounds
JavaScript30 website first project. The website was successfully made. I am proud of myself. Thank God

This is a drumkit project made using the first tutorial in JavaScript30.com I am glad and appreciate these people who take the time from their day to make tutorials such as these. I pray I get a job in programming soon. God first :D

I forgot to put the sound files in a folder, but I will accept that accident, for today. I got the sounds from zapsplat.com free downloads.
